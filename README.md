# Pytorch-Disease-Human-Multiclass-Image-Classification

Build a multi-class human disease image classification application using deep learning with pretrained ResNet34 set to 'true'. The dataset is taken from the kaggle repository, source dataset intel: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018, in the form of a Retinal OCT image dataset, consisting of 4 classes namely CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL. Classification is done by performing data normalization, data transformation, and handling unbalanced datasets. The classification results obtained that the test accuracy reached 94%. I made this application where the entire process and visualization use the Plotly Dash framework, HTML, and CSS.
