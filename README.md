# Pytorch-Disease-Human-Multiclass-Image-Classification

Build a multi-class human disease image classification application using deep learning with pretrained ResNet34 set to 'true'. The dataset is taken from the kaggle repository, source dataset retinal oct: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018, in the form of a Retinal OCT image dataset, consisting of 4 classes namely 'CNV', 'DME', 'DRUSEN', and 'NORMAL'. Classification is done by performing data normalization, data transformation, and handling unbalanced datasets. The classification results obtained that the test accuracy reached 94% with 15 epochs. I made this application where the entire process and visualization use the Plotly Dash framework, HTML, and CSS.

Build a multi-class human disease image classification application using deep learning with pretrained ResNet50 set to 'false'. The dataset is taken from the kaggle repository, source dataset colorectal histology: https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist, in the form of a Colorectal Hostology MNIST image dataset, consisting of 8 classes namely 'Tumor', 'Stroma', 'Complex', 'Lympho', 'Debris', 'Mucosa', 'Adipose', and 'Empty'. Classification is done by performing data transformation because each class is balanced. The classification results obtained that the test accuracy reached 93% with 15 epochs. I made this application where the entire process and visualization use the Plotly Dash framework, HTML, and CSS.
